# ARM_LEGV8_CPU
This repository contains the source code for an ARM LEGv8 CPU written in Verilog.

This CPU is based on the ARM architecture from the textbook: *Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface ARM Edition by D. Patterson and J. Hennessy, Morgan Kaufmann*

**I'm currently working on it ...**
