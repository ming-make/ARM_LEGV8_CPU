# ARM_LEGV8_CPU
This repository contains the source code for an ARM LEGv8 CPU written in Verilog.

This CPU is based on the ARM architecture from the textbook: *Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface ARM Edition by D. Patterson and J. Hennessy, Morgan Kaufmann*

**I'm currently working on it ...**

PS:This is an 'involution' version of CPU because designing a CPU based on the ARM architecture could get a higher score :)

> Expected to be completed by the end of July

> In the near future, I will complete a CPU based on the RISC-V architecture which I'm interested in.
